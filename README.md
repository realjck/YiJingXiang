> The Book of Changes – I Ching in Chinese – is unquestionably one of the most important books in the world's literature. Nearly all that is greatest and most significant in the three thousand years of Chinese cultural history has either taken its inspiration from this book, or has exerted an influence on the interpretation of its text. Both of the two branches of Chinese philosophy, Confucianism and Taoism, have their common roots here.
